\title{Test the difference of the network connectivity between two groups}
\usage{
permDif(dat, vars, group, subjnr, level1, level2 = NULL,
  randomVars = F, perms = 500, optim = "bobyqa")
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{data frame}

\item{vars}{vector with the names of the variables which are centered.}

\item{group}{dichotomous variable that indicates the two groups to be compared}

\item{subjnr}{identification number of the subjects}

\item{level1}{variable, indicating level 1 variable, e.g. beeps. Must be specified.}

\item{level2}{variable, indicating level 2 variable, e.g. days. Can be left empty.}

\item{randomVars}{logical, indicating whether the variables should be included as random effects.}

\item{perms}{number of permutations.}

\item{optim}{optimizer used in lmer, options: "bobyqa" or "Nelder_Mead", see lmerControl (lme4)}
}
\value{
Estimate of difference between groups wrt network connectivity with p value based on permutations.
         and permutation distribution. The p-values for differences of all individual paths and of summaries are given.
